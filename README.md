# Crude Chat Bot

A class project that my friend was working on that I picked up to do myself.  This is a simple chat bot that will provide not-so-sophisticated responses to
a user's inputs.  The work was done on my own; however, the keyword function I did with the help from a friend and the preprocess function was finished with
the help of a Python help site.  Both functions have references cited.
